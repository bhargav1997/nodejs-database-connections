Let's break down these concepts:

**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** and **ODM (Object-Document Mapping)** are techniques that facilitate the interaction between your 
application and a database using the object-oriented paradigm. They allow you to work with objects and classes in your code, 
which map to tables (in relational databases) or documents (in document databases).

**Sequelize** is an ORM for SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. It allows you to interact with your database 
using JavaScript objects instead of writing SQL queries.

**Mongoose** is an ODM for MongoDB. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data and includes 
built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.

Here's a simple example of how you can use Mongoose to interact with MongoDB:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

const Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', { name: String });

const kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zildjian' });
kitty.save().then(() => console.log('meow'));
```

In this example, we first connect to our MongoDB database. Then we define a model `Cat` with a single property `name` of type `String`. 
We then create a new `Cat` instance and save it to the database. Mongoose takes care of translating these operations into MongoDB commands under the hood.

Similarly, here's a simple example of how you can use Sequelize to interact with a SQL database:

```javascript
const { Sequelize, Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:');

class User extends Model {}
User.init({
  username: DataTypes.STRING,
  birthday: DataTypes.DATE
}, { sequelize, modelName: 'user' });

sequelize.sync()
  .then(() => User.create({
    username: 'janedoe',
    birthday: new Date(1980, 6, 20)
  }))
  .then(jane => {
    console.log(jane.toJSON());
  });
```

In this example, we first connect to our SQLite database. Then we define a model `User` with properties `username` and `birthday`. 
We then sync our model with the database and create a new `User` instance.

These libraries provide a high-level abstraction over the underlying database commands and allow developers to write less, 
more maintainable code. They also provide additional features like data validation, relationships, and transactions.

Remember, while ORMs/ODMs can make development easier, they can also add overhead and may not be suitable for all use cases.
It's important to understand the trade-offs and choose the right tool for your needs.
